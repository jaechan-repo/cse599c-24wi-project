# Attention is All You Align

Project repository for CSE 599c taught in the 2024 winter. 
Root folder contains:
- `aligner`: to be treated as a single module (imported or called by scripts outside this module). Contains all the key implementations.
- `train`: training scripts
- `eval`: evaluation scripts

## Coding Conventions
- Readable code. The use of `typing` (type hinting) is encouraged.
- Common Conda environment for `Python 3.10`. Expected to run on `attu`/`hyak`.
